# NASA APOD

Nasa APOD is Nasa's famous open API to get Astronomy Picture Of the Day.
I developed my Android application Nasa APOD based on this API using Retrofit
in Kotlin. Development took two days and this application includes some of
popular Android practices, such as MVC, SplashScreen, Google Firebase and more.
Currently application has API @GET request modified to get 20 random Nasa APOD
photos with descriptions, authors and so on.

>When opening application for the first time, you get LogIn page after 5-second SplashScreen.
On LogIn page you can login with current email and password or hit Sign Up and enter mail and
password in order to sign up. After logging in or signing up, you will get to the main APOD
fragment, where you can see APOD. On the header there are two buttons: Hide/Show text and Profile buttons.
When you get to your profile, you can change password (currently in Development) or sign out.

Nasa APOD android application is based on single activity practice and is oriented
on performance. I know, my code is a little bit messy, but it is just initial version
of full application.
